# Tesla Stocks Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning:

# Introduction:
In this project, I developed a comprehensive model to predict Tesla's stock prices using both machine learning and deep learning techniques. The primary goal was to create an accurate and robust model that can provide valuable insights and assist in making informed investment decisions.

# Project Overview:
The project consists of several key stages:

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collected historical stock price data from source.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and create relevant time series features.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted an in-depth analysis to understand the underlying patterns and trends in the stock data.
Visualized various aspects of the data using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Feature Engineering:

Created additional features to capture important patterns and signals in the data.
Engineered features like moving averages, trading volumes, and other technical indicators.

# Model Building:

Implemented several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Developed deep learning models using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies in the stock price data.

# Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Compared the results of different models to identify the most accurate and reliable approach.

# Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the machine learning and deep learning models to optimize their performance.
Used techniques like Grid Search and Random Search to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

# Prediction and Visualization:

Made predictions on test data using the trained models.
Visualized the predicted vs. actual stock prices to assess the accuracy of the models.

# Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git

# Results and Insights:
The deep learning model, particularly the LSTM network, showed superior performance in predicting Tesla's stock prices compared to traditional machine learning models. The LSTM model effectively captured the temporal dependencies and trends, resulting in more accurate predictions.

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning and deep learning techniques in predicting stock prices. The LSTM model's ability to learn from historical data and make accurate predictions can be a valuable tool for investors and analysts.
